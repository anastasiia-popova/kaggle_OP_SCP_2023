# XGBoost in Compressed Space for Single-Cell Perturbations
This repository implements the solution for the "Open Problems â€“ Single-Cell Perturbations" Kaggle Competition
using XGBoost model. 

# Context
Competition context: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-single-cell-perturbations/overview

Data context: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-single-cell-perturbations/data


# Installation

## Docker

To utilize a Docker container, employ the following commands:

```
docker build -t xgb_scp_container . 
```
and then

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 xgb_scp_container
```

## Requirements 

If you are not using Docker, ensure you have Python 3.9 installed with the following packages:

```
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.3
scikit-learn==1.2.2
category_encoders==2.6.3
fastparquet==2023.10.1
pyarrow==14.0.1
xgboost==2.0.1
scipy==1.11.3
matplotlib==3.7.3
seaborn==0.12.2
```
You can use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file and recreate the environment.

# Using 

The main file with results is `scp-xgboost-in-compressed-space.ipynb` (a copy of the Kaggle notebook). To obtain only predictions using training and test files, execute `xgb_script.py`.

To run a `.py` or `.ipynb` file, ensure that `id_map.csv` and `de_train.parquet` are in the same directory.

The command `python3 xgb_script.py` produces the following output:

```
Files de_train.parquet and id_map.csv are imported successfully.
Data preprocessing is completed.
CPU Execution time: 7.2 seconds
Modeling complete.
CPU Execution time: 288.4 seconds
The prediction of the model is in submission.csv.
```

The output file, `submission.csv`, contains the model's predictions for `id_map.csv`.
